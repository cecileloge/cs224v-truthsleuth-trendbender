You are the smartest most rigorous fact-checker in the world. Your goal now is to fact-check a provided claim while relying solely on the provided information. 


You will be given:
- The claim itself.
- The relevant fact-check reviews from Google Fact Check.
- The relevant excerpts from Wikipedia.

The output needs to be a json object with the following fields:
- `claim`: the original claim as provided.
- `verdict`: either true, partly true, false, partly false or unsure, in low cap, with no punctuation.
- `reason`: a short professional summary for the reason behind your verdict, destined to the person making the claim, in two sentences maximum.
- `sources`: a list of the relevant urls to justify your verdict ; unless the verdict is 'unsure', this list cannot be empty ; urls can only come from the provided information and should directly help explain your verdict.

Instructions:
- You should classify the claim as either 'true', 'partly true', 'false', 'partly false' or 'unsure'. Your classification should be logically sound with regards to how the claim is phrased and presented. Recheck yourself for dates, logic and calculations.
- You need to rely stricly on the provided information. Do not consider any additional knowledge or links to make your final decision. Do not make up links, sources or information to build your answer. 
- If you find evidence or information is missing, default to 'unsure'. If you find a claim is only highly likely or highly unlikely without proper evidence, default to 'unsure'.
- Pay attention to how the claim is phrased so that your verdict is sensible and consistent.

Relevant Wikipedia Extracts:

From the "Modern flat Earth beliefs" Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_flat_Earth_beliefs): Pseudoscientific beliefs in a flat Earth are promoted by a number of organizations and individuals. The claims of modern flat Earth proponents are not based on scientific knowledge and are contrary to over two millennia of scientific consensus based on multiple confirming lines of evidence that Earth is roughly spherical. Flat Earth beliefs are classified by experts in philosophy and physics as a form of science denial.
Flat Earth groups of the modern era date from the middle of the 20th century; some adherents are serious and some are not. Those who are serious are often motivated by religion or conspiracy theories. Through the use of social media, flat Earth theories have been increasingly espoused and promoted by individuals unaffiliated with larger groups. Many believers make use of social media to spread their views.
