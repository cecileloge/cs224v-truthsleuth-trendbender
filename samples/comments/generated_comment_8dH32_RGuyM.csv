But I'm a little worried about the ""21-day challenge"" and the emphasis on ""Fast Results.""  Rapid weight loss, especially for teens, can be incredibly harmful and potentially trigger eating disorders.  The claim that Coke Zero won't cause weight gain is also misleading; while calorie-free, it's not health-promoting.  Focusing on sustainable lifestyle changes and balanced nutrition, with professional guidance if needed, is key.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_disorder https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/diet-culture

When I was only twelve I started feeling insecure about my height and weight as my drama teacher told me that I was too fat to ever get a role in my school plays. This taunted me. I was NOT fat as I weighed around 45 kg and was 5 '3. I used to do a secret workout in my room at 2:00 am and TRUST ME that did not do anything. I've seen comments saying they are insecure about their weight being 55 kg and that they have tried anything. Honestly growing up is overrated. I should've enjoyed my teen years but instead I was to busy feeling self-conscious. Sorry to the person I took this comment from but here she says ""My actual weight is 56.8kg for 164cm (I think) and my goal is 49kg I know it will be dangerous for my health but I want to be skinny!"" YOUR HEALTH IS SO IMPORTANT. Your personal health is way more important than your want to be skinny. Especially for teens. You don't need to worry about your weight this young and, in my own opinion should not worry UNLESS you ARE overweight at any age and even then don't let it hang over you. If you are being bullied then find a friend who will block them out, if you can't then tell someone, I know how hard it can be but it's worth it at the end when you don't have the crushing weight on your shoulders. I know this video is well put together and clearly whoever made it does not want you to feel this way but sometimes watching these is just wasting your childhood. If you are insecure about your weight and are a little chubby then go on walks, do yoga, make it something you enjoy doing, go 80 20 for healthy and fast foods, but most of all, remind yourself that you are doing this for your mental health and enjoyment to not just for losing weight, also miracles won't happen in a week, if you stick to your activity then maybe you might loose a kg or two but you might also subconsciously feel just a tiny bit better about yourself. Love you Xx","I hear you.  It's incredibly tough dealing with those feelings, especially as a teen. The video's ""21-day challenge"" promising a body transformation and fast results is misleading.  Rapid weight loss is rarely sustainable and can be harmful;  the video's focus on a specific diet plan, neglecting diverse needs, is also concerning.  Prioritizing health over quick fixes is key. Your worth isn't tied to your weight. https://www.mentalhealth.com/library/teenagers-eating-disorders-unhealthy-dieting  https://kidshealth.org/en/teens/dieting.html

Nepal sounds beautiful! üòä I saw your comment and wanted to gently point out something from the video. Mehak's claim that her 21-day plan offers ""fast results"" for teenage weight loss is misleading and potentially harmful.  The plan itself lacks crucial nutritional considerations for teens and doesn't account for diverse dietary needs.  Sustainable weight management requires a holistic approach,  prioritizing long-term health over quick fixes.

I especially noticed the ""no more starving, no more deprivation"" part. But rapid weight loss, especially for teens, can be risky. The fact-check report shows that  quick fixes are often unsustainable and may lead to nutritional deficiencies: [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2646175/]. Sustainable changes are key. Prioritizing health and wellbeing over unrealistic goals is crucial.

I see you're asking about intermittent fasting.  The video actually advises against skipping meals, especially for teens still growing (""don't even think about skipping meals or cutting down too much; your health comes first""), and  intermittent fasting can be quite intense. It's really not a one-size-fits-all approach, and has many aspects not discussed here. Before trying anything drastic, especially for someone your age, please talk to a doctor or registered dietitian. They can assess your individual needs and help you understand the potential risks involved.

I understand the excitement around quick transformations, especially that ""21-day challenge"" promise. But let's look at the plan's specifics.  The video suggests a restrictive diet, potentially harmful for teens.  Rapid weight loss can be detrimental to growth and well-being;  it's crucial to prioritize sustainable habits.  The claim that skipping meals won't stunt growth (as mentioned in the video) needs more nuance: severe calorie restriction *does* harm growth. ([https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2720870/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2720870/)). Also,  the video's focus on one cultural diet might exclude others' needs.

The video's claim that ""Your body isn't into quick fixes"" is accurate, and focusing on long-term healthy habits is key.  Instead of a number on the scale, let's prioritize feeling good, inside and out. It's a journey, not a race.

ingredients: 
spinach (4-5 leaves )
lettuce ( 4 to 5 leaves) 
coriander ( with stems ) 
1 cucumber  
1 apples
mint leaves 
lemon juice 
ginger  1 inch 
4 to 5 glass of water 
add all of these ingredients in blender and blend them for 4 minutes .
if you want you can starin it but I don't strain it cause I want fiber and fiber helps in digestion and absorption of nutrients .
 I have been drinking this for 1 week and I see a lot of differences in my skin condition and is also a good option to get all the nutrients if you don't like to eat veggies .","That's a creative solution for getting your veggies!  I see you're aiming for a nutrient boost, and focusing on fiber is great for digestion, as mentioned in this research on the benefits of water before meals for satiety and digestion. However, keep in mind that while this juice sounds delicious and might improve your skin, it's not a complete replacement for the range of nutrients you get from eating various colorful vegetables.  A varied diet, as this article on the benefits of colorful vegetables explains, is key for balanced nutrition.  This other article discusses the importance of diverse nutrients for mental health, which is also crucial alongside physical health.
