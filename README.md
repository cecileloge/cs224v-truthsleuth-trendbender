**Motivation:** Misinformation is one of the most pressing threats of our time, and YouTube videos serve as a major platform through which it can spread. Providing fact-checked information to address misleading content has been shown to be more effective than simply removing it. But even beyond this, we want to use that information to interact with users, challenge the presented narrative, keep the discussion away from hate/conspiracy and ultimately even change their minds. Our system comprises two main agents: **Truth Sleuth** (for fact-checking) and **Trend Bender** (for interacting with users).

Here you will find: 
* **prompts**: all the prompts we have used for our experiments, as well as final prompts for each agent,
* **samples**: sample outputs from the Truth Sleuth agent (fact-check reports) and from the Trend Bender agent (generated comments), as well as some examples of real user interactions,
* **notebooks**:
    * "TruthSleuth.ipynb" is the base Truth Sleuth agent (claim extraction, RAG, report generation),
    * "TruthSleuth_Evaluation.ipynb" is where we evaluate Truth Sleuth on the FEVER & AVeriTeC datasets,
    * "TruthSleuth_TrendBender.ipynb" is the system from start to finish, with both agents.

**Truth Sleuth** extracts claims from a YouTube video, uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach - drawing on sources like Wikipedia, Google Search, Google FactCheck - to accurately assess their veracity and generates a nuanced and comprehensive report. Through rigorous prompt engineering, **Trend Bender** leverages this report along with a curated corpus of relevant articles to generate insightful and persuasive comments designed to stimulate a productive debate. With a carefully set up self-evaluation loop, this agent is able to iteratively improve its style and refine its output.

We experimented with two themes:
**Theme 1**: Dangerous Diet Recommendations & Health Claims.
**Theme 2**: Manosphere & Misogynistic videos.
